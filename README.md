# CryptAnalyzer

## Instruction and Description

### The program has three options for working:

1. Encoding - you must specify the cryptographic key (key = offset in the alphabet), the path to the `.txt` file using
   `UTF-8` encoding and `Cyrillic`. 
   The result of the program will be saved to a new file located in the same directory.
2. Decoding - you must specify the cryptographic key, the path to the `.txt` file. 
   The result of the program will be saved to a new file located in the same directory.
3. Brute force - you must specify the path to the `.txt` file. The program independently recognizes the source text.
   The result of the program will be saved to a new file located in the same directory.

### Package resources
There are two test files to check the performance of the program in package resources.
